        <h1><span>Background</span></h1>
        <p>My name is Elethu Cotyi i was born on December 2003, in Cape Town, Khayelitsha, i did my studies at Harry Gwala Senior Secondary School where i gruadated with a Bachelor's Degree.
           While is was growing up i had a passion for technological items e.g [Computer,Smartphones,Game Consoles]which attracted my attention very much, but the computer is the most one that caught my attention due to: 
            <li>they are fast and efficient</li> 
            <li>they are easy to use</li>
            <li>they enable you to make and save money</li>
            <li>they provide accurate information1</li>
            <li>they are good for gaming</li>
            <li>they allow for effortless communications</li>
            <li>they are an important tool for science students, who generally rely on them in preparing their educational reports and projects</li>
            <br>
            I heard from a friend of mine that theres is more to learn from a computer deeply since we both loved it we took our passion to start our journeys to learn
            the creative side of coding
           which is low stress and job positions never end which motivates me to keep on improving myself to become a better coder and learn new things in the IT industry.
